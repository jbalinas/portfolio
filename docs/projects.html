            <p> BowlMates is a unique web-based application specializes in connecting people for dining experiences based on restaurant preferences, location, and availability. Utilizing a full-stack approach with React, MySQL, and Node.js, the app seeks to offer a user-friendly experience while facilitating meaningful social connections through shared meals.</p>
            <p> While this started as a capstone-like project for UW CSE403: Software Engineering, it quickly became a passion project that extended past the class. Currently, I am working to migrate it to a cross-platform mobile application.</p>

            <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ld6Tc3EEWj8?si=5DgiuyGg56ewfXvH" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
            <p> Circle of Sound proposes the creation of interactive and exploratory digital tools to enhance understanding and engagement with the circle of fifths, a fundamental concept in music theory. Traditionally taught through static diagrams, the circle of fifths can be complex and intimidating for aspiring musicians, presenting a significant learning curve. We seek to transform this learning experience into an intuitive, engaging journey through an interactive visualization.</p>
            <p> The interactive nature of these tools are designed to provide a hands-on learning experience. Users will not only visualize but also engage with the music theory concepts, making abstract ideas tangible and easier to comprehend. By incorporating audio feedback through Tone.js, learners can hear the impact of their interactions, further enriching the learning process. This project aims to democratize music theory education, making it more accessible and enjoyable for both novices and experienced musicians. </p>
